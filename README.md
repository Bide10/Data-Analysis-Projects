# Data Analysis Projects

Hello and Welcome to my Github repository :D


Here I am going to upload all the Data Analysis/Science projects I will be performing 
For all the projects uploaded till now , feel free to download and see for yourself at your own pace.


To download : open the ipynb file and click on the download button to download the jupyter notebook of the project.
              And dont worry the datasets are right below the jupyter notebook those are in .csv and .xlsx format.

To Run : you need to have jupyter notebook software and installed python 3.9. 
         Then just open the Jupyter notebook and it will straight open the Jupyter notebook dashboard from where you can navigate to the downloaded file location to open          it. After it's open select 'cell' and 'run all cells' this will run the entire project. 

Thank you and your feedback would be very much appreciated.
