# Exploratory Data Analysis on FIFA 18 using Python 

FIFA along with gaming studio EA Sports created a series of games named FIFA. This franchise started from FIFA95, the first edition of this gaming franchise till FIFA 23 the latest edition after which their partnership ended. Now they are going to create this legendary football game series separately.

Here I have taken the dataset for FIFA 18 the 2018 edition of the game and analysed it to find interesting insights. How are the wages and ages of players related? What factors contribute to a player's overall rating or market value? I combined my love for football and data science to whip up a short exploratory analysis of the FIFA 18 dataset using Python.
