# Customer Churn Prediction Using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)


### ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

Customer retention is a critical factor for businesses aiming to achieve long-term success. Losing existing customers, commonly referred to as customer churn, can significantly impact revenue and brand reputation. This project demonstrates how data-driven solutions can empower businesses to proactively address churn by identifying at-risk customers and taking timely action.

In this project, I developed a predictive model using Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) to analyze customer behavior and forecast churn likelihood. The model is designed to help companies make informed, data-backed decisions to retain customers and optimize their customer relationship management strategies.


### ðŸ§© Problem Statement
The Bank faces a persistent challenge: identifying which customers are likely to stop using their products or services in the near future as they face increasing churn rates. The goal of this project is to create a demographic centric model to tell the bank which of their customers are at highest risk of leaving. 


### ðŸš€ Proposed Solution
To address the above challenges, I implemented a supervised learning approach using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). Hereâ€™s how the solution was designed:

* Data Collection and Preprocessing:
Historical customer data, including demographic (country, age, gender, name), behavioral (number of products subscribed, has credit card or not, is an active member or not), and transactional information (salary, balance, credit score), was collected.
Data preprocessing steps were performed, normalizing features, and encoding categorical variables.

* Feature Engineering:
Identified key features influencing churn, such as tenure, usage patterns, and customer satisfaction levels.
Created derived features to enhance model performance.

* Model Development:
Built an ANN with optimized layers and activation functions to handle the complexity of the data.
Used binary classification to predict churn likelihood, where:
1 = Customer is likely to churn.
0 = Customer is likely to stay.

* Evaluation and Optimization:
The model was trained and validated using an 80-20 train-test split.
Key metrics such as accuracy and binary crossentropy were used to evaluate model performance.

* Insights and Business Recommendations:
Identified the top predictors of churn, providing actionable insights for business decision-making.
Suggested targeted retention strategies based on customer risk scores generated by the model.
