# Customer Churn Prediction Using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)


### ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

Customer retention is a critical factor for businesses aiming to achieve long-term success. Losing existing customers, commonly referred to as customer churn, can significantly impact revenue and brand reputation. This project demonstrates how data-driven solutions can empower businesses to proactively address churn by identifying at-risk customers and taking timely action.

In this project, I developed a predictive model using Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) to analyze customer behavior and forecast churn likelihood. The model is designed to help companies make informed, data-backed decisions to retain customers and optimize their customer relationship management strategies.
