# Data Analysis Projects

Hello and Welcome to my Github repository :D


ðŸš€ Exploring the universe of data, I'm Bideepto, a Data Scientist weaving engineering precision with corporate acumen. In the dynamic interplay of information, my mission is to transmute raw data into strategic gold, igniting success for businesses.

Right now, Iâ€™m diving deep into the world of weather nowcasting, building some pretty cool deep learning models with complex CNN and RNN architectures. Itâ€™s all about predicting the skies with real-time accuracy and making sense of meteorological data.

This repository contains all of my data analysis and deep learning projects performed over time. Feel free to download and explore! Each project includes a brief introduction, the Python notebook files, and the datasets used. You are welcome to perform your own analysis and provide feedback, suggestions, or rectifications. Let's collaborate and learn together! :D




## To download : 
Open the ipynb file and click on the download button to download the jupyter notebook of the project.
And dont worry the datasets are right below the jupyter notebook those are in .csv and .xlsx format.

## To Run : 
You need to have jupyter notebook software and python 3.9 installed. 
Then just open the Jupyter notebook and it will straight open the Jupyter notebook dashboard from where you can navigate to the downloaded file location to open          it. After it's open select 'cell' and 'run all cells' this will run the entire project. 

Thank you and your feedback would be very much appreciated.
