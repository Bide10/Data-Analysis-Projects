# Task 3: Data Insights and Presentation
  - Using visualisations to present insights
# Task 4: Perform Business Analysis
  - Perform clustering or other necessary techniques required for 'customer segmentation' and gain more insights
# Task 5: Device Business StrategiesÂ¶

In this project I have performed Data cleaning techniques , Exploratory Data analysis to gain some basic insights ,Performed Data Visualizations for representations of the features, then prepared the dataset for K means clustering and RFM Analysis for proper customer segmentation.


The results were such that 4 segments of customers were formed namely: "Best Customers","High Spending Customers","Low Spending Active Loyal Customers","Churned Best Customers". Business strategies were given separately for each group so that effective marketing can be done and customer conversion rate can be increased and in return the total revenue can increase.
