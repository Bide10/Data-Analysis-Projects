# Second hand car price prediction:

There is a significant number of 2nd hand cars being sold in the U.S.A , so, I collected a dataset containing the details of those cars and wanted to figure out what factors actually contribute to the 2nd hand pricing of the car and wanted to build a model which can predict the price of any given 2nd hand car. <br>
The objective of this project is to analyze a dataset containing details of second-hand cars and use statistical models to predict car prices based on various criteria. By examining this dataset, I aim to answer several business questions as stated below, related to second-hand car pricing and gain insights that can help in decision-making processes within the automotive industry. <br>
I performed data cleaning , and pre processing before conducting statistical analysis to gain more insights. In order to use predictive models we need a baseline model first and then a model with better accuracy. Baselines are also very important as they can help in gaining more insights and can also be used for testing assumptions. In this project I used Linear Regression as baseline model and as expected it has a very low accuracy. <br>
Results: As expected our orediction model isn't accurate and overestimates the target variable by a significant margin. This was expected from a baseline model. other findings are : 
1. Maximum of the 2nd hand cars are manufactured from 2008 to 2014. 
2. Leather Interrior is common among the cars.
3. Petrol cars dominate the market.
4. Black, White , Silver are the preferred colours
5. Half of the cars are priced below 12000 $

### Note: Linear Regression is used only as a baseline model and not final one. There is a lot of scope for this project. I will be working on this project and uploading while at it. If you come across this project and want to suggest any changes/upgrades/models feel free to reach out to me anytime :D
