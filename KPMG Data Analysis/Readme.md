In this project we need to identify various errors and inconsistencies and clean the dataset while pointing out the problems with the raw dataset and solving them.

I will be following the below mentioned steps for my data cleaning process :

checking data accuracy
checking data completeness
data consistency
data currency
data relevancy
data validity (i.e., containing allowable values or not)
and lastly data uniqueness
