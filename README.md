# Data Analysis Projects

Hello and Welcome to my Github repository :D


ðŸš€ Exploring the universe of data, I'm Bideepto, a passionate Data Analyst weaving engineering precision with corporate acumen. In the dynamic interplay of information, my mission is to transmute raw data into strategic gold, igniting success for businesses.
This Repositoy will contain all of my data analysis projects performed over the course of time. Feel free to download and if you want you can perform your own analysis as well, I have provided a short introduction to all the individual projects inside the project files along with the python notebook file and dataset used. Any kind of feedback/suggestion/rectification is always welcome :D 


## To download : 
Open the ipynb file and click on the download button to download the jupyter notebook of the project.
And dont worry the datasets are right below the jupyter notebook those are in .csv and .xlsx format.

## To Run : 
You need to have jupyter notebook software and python 3.9 installed. 
Then just open the Jupyter notebook and it will straight open the Jupyter notebook dashboard from where you can navigate to the downloaded file location to open          it. After it's open select 'cell' and 'run all cells' this will run the entire project. 

Thank you and your feedback would be very much appreciated.
