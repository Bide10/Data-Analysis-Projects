# Customer Churn Prediction Using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)


### ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

Customer retention is a critical factor for businesses aiming to achieve long-term success. Losing existing customers, commonly referred to as customer churn, can significantly impact revenue and brand reputation. This project demonstrates how data-driven solutions can empower businesses to proactively address churn by identifying at-risk customers and taking timely action.

In this project, I developed a predictive model using Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) to analyze customer behavior and forecast churn likelihood. The model is designed to help companies make informed, data-backed decisions to retain customers and optimize their customer relationship management strategies.


### ðŸ§© Problem Statement
The company faces a persistent challenge: identifying which customers are likely to stop using their products or services in the near future. Traditional approaches to addressing churn often rely on retrospective analysis, limiting their ability to take preemptive action.

Key questions addressed:
What factors influence customer churn?
How can we accurately predict whether a customer is at risk of churning?
How can the company leverage predictive analytics to implement retention strategies effectively?
